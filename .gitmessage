# |<----  Using a Maximum Of 50 Characters  ---->|

# Type can be:
#   feat     (new feature)
#   fix      (bug fix)
#   docs     (changes to documentation)
#   style    (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
#   refactor (refactoring production code)
#   test     (adding missing tests, refactoring tests)
#   chore    (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
# --------------------
# Remember to:
#   * Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   * Do not end the subject line with a period
#   * Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   * Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   * Can use multiple lines with "-" for bullet points in body
